🏭 Smart Factory Monitoring System

This project simulates a *Smart Factory Monitoring System* using *Arduino UNO, designed and tested virtually in **Wokwi Simulator*.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The system monitors key environmental conditions in a factory environment using:

- 🌡️ *Temperature* sensor (LM35)
- 💨 *Gas leakage* sensor (MQ-2)
- 🕵️ *Motion* detection (PIR sensor)
- 🔔 *Alert system* with buzzer and LED
- 📺 *LCD Display* for real-time readings

## 🛠 How It Works

- Reads analog temperature and gas data
- Detects motion using a PIR sensor
- Displays temperature and gas readings on a 16x2 LCD
- Activates buzzer and LED for:
  - Gas value above threshold
  - Motion detection

---

## ✅ Features

- Fully virtual simulation (no hardware needed)
- Real-time alert triggers
- Compact and well-commented Arduino code
- Beginner-friendly project for embedded systems
